Recursion v/s iteration
# if we can divide prolem to similar/same sub problems - use recursion
# Prominent usage of recursion is in trees and graphs. 
	Tree is like hierarchical where each sub hierarchy is a same structure leaving the first one.
# Recursion asked in interviews. 
# Recursion used in Divide and conquer, greedy and dynamic prog. 
==============

How Rec Works ?

# Two things are imp
1. Base case : Exit from the loop
2. Recursive Case : method calls itself

def RecursionFunction(params):
	if This_Happens:
		exit_from_Loop
	else:
		RecursionFunction(params_Others)
		
# Python uses a stack memory to store all functions 

nth_function_call

..
.
3rd_function_call
2nd_function_call
1st_function_call
==================
Execution happens from last to first, i.e. nth call, n-1th call .... uptill 1st function.
