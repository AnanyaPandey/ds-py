Arrays - Memory 
--------------------

1D 2D 3D

1D - 9 elements
9 continuous cells are allocated. 
( CONTINuOUS )  no gap between memory cells for arrays.
this is useful in locality of reference.

2D ARRAY 

rows - 0,1,2
columns - 0,1,2

This is arranged in rows 
row1,row2,row3
[a,b,c,3,4,5,g,h,j]

3D - also arranged in memory row wise. 
depth 0 - row 0, depth 0 row 2 de3pth 1 row 0 de3pth 1 row 1 .....
all the elements are aligned next to each other one row after the other.
