Queue can be created in python using these modules.
====================================================
Collections Module
Queue module
Multiprocessing module

collections.deque - Ecellent performance uses double linkedlist
Can be used for queue and stack.

Methods: 
- deque() - create queue of maxlength

- popleft() - dequeue
- clear() - clear deletes all elements in queue

This is not a circular queue but it will keep overriding if we keep appending items after the max length.
